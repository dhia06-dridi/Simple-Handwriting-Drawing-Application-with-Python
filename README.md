# Simple-Handwriting-Drawing-Application-with-Python
This code creates a drawing application with Tkinter where the user can draw on a black canvas using the mouse. The strokes are recorded in an image (with Pillow) to allow saving as a PNG file. It includes two buttons to clear the drawing or save it. The application is simple and intuitive for drawing handwritten letters or numbers.
